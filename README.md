# jnode_nix

This repository contains a proof-of-concept converter of EEG data in a Matlab format
 to the [NIX format](https://github.com/G-Node/nix).

This prototype is no longer actively developed and the repository is archived. The importer has 
been integrated into the [wagatonix](https://github.com/G-Node/wagatonix) Python library 
and any further development will be integrated into and distributed via this library.
